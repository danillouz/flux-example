# flux-example
Example application demonstrating (server) action creators for the crowdynews
[react-flux presentation](http://slides.com/danillouz/react-flux#/).

### installing dependencies
```
npm i
```

### watch the repository to automagically (re)build
```
npm start
```

Note that after executing `npm start`, a new file named `build.js` will
be generated in the `dist` directory. This file is loaded in the `index.html`.

### build and minify the code
```
npm run build
```

Note that after executing `npm run build`, a new file named `build.min.js` will
be generated in the `dist` directory.

### clean all build files
```
npm run clean
```
